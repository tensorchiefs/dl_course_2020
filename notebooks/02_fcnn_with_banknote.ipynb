Therefore a single neuron is not appropriate to model the probability for a fake banknote based on its two features. To get a more flexible model, we introduce an additional layer between input layer and output layer. This is called hidden layer. Here we use a hidden layer with 8 neurons. We also change the ouputnodes form 1 to 2, to get two ouputs for the probability of real and fake banknote. Because we now have 2 outputs, we use the *softmax* activation function in the output layer. The softmax activation ensures that the output can be interpreted as a probability (see book for details)"
